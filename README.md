# CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet

## A Codecademy Project

The goal of this project was to familiarise myself with creating tables... *sexy* tables... 
*(bites lip)* :smiling_imp: using HTML and CSS. 

In doing so, I should have learned how to structure a table with the following tags:

* `<table>`
* `<thead>`
* `<th>`
* `<tbody>`
* `<tr>`
* `<td>`

Also, this was an exercise in improving my design skills by doing the following:

* Google 2022 web design trends
* Study the page's CSS
* Cherry-pick the elements I like from several sites and mix them together :new_moon_with_face:

Right now, I'm a big fan of the whole linework look. Thin and sharp black borders, beautiful 
typography, and transparent icons... *chef's kiss* :kiss:

### Planned Changes

Obviously this particular cheatsheet is a work in progress. I want to remove the cells after 
the first `td` in each table so the tables won't look so exhaustingly repetitive. I also want 
the CSS properties and values to take up less space while remaining readable. 

I also think that they could benefit from some more whitespace. :eyes:

Finally, I'd like to create a strong graphic look with a modern retro-ish (oxymoron?) 
colour and a subtle pattern for the background and a nice solid dropshadow on the tables. 

I know, I know. It seems like a lot of effort for a few tables. But who said they had to look 
ugly?
